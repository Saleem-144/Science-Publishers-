              Dr. Daniel C. Hoessli is a medical graduate from the University of Geneva. He was trained as an immunologist in the labs of Herman Eisen (Washington University, St. Louis) and Byron Waksman (Yale University). Following his return to Geneva, (department of pathology and immunology, University of Geneva, faculty of medicine), he became involved in the study of lymphocyte surface proteins and receptors, and more generally, in the structure of plasma membranes. Following this lead, he contributed to the concept of plasma membrane rafts, or plasma membrane microdomains, which constitute specialized domains where transmembrane signaling can be initiated. After his retirement from the University of Geneva, he started a fruitful Pakistani collaboration with Professors Nasir-du-Din at the Institute of molecular sciences and bioinformatics in Lahore and Iqbal Chaudhary and Atta-ur-Rahman in Karachi (ICCBS).

              Michael Kahn, Ph.D., is professor and chair of the Department of Molecular Medicine at City of Hope's comprehensive cancer center. He comes to City of Hope from University of Southern California, where he was first appointed as the provost professor, with joint appointments in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Keck School of Medicine of USC and the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology in the USC School of Pharmacy. After completing his postdoctoral training at Columbia University with Professor Gilbert Stork, Ph.D., Dr. Kahn subsequently did a second postdoctoral fellowship at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, where he first became interested in utilizing novel chemistry to complement and enhance the investigation of complex biological signaling pathways. Dr. Kahn's research program is focused on the integration of basic science with translational medicine. His lab utilizes a forward chemical genomic strategy to identify and validate novel pharmacologic tools to study complex signaling pathways in development and disease. From a translational perspective, these studies led to the development of the second-generation CBP/β-catenin antagonist, Wnt modulating drug, PRI-724. These efforts resulted in the clinical trials of PRI-724 in colon and pancreatic cancer, leukemia and liver fibrosis.
