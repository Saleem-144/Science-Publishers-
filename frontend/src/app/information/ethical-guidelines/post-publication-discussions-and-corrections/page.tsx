            Bentham Open recognizes the importance of post-publication discussions on published research, and
            its journals remain open to such scholarly discourse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Post-publication discussions may be published online after review and are typically accompanied by
            a response from the original authors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instructions to Authors are available on individual journal websites and should be consulted for
            submission criteria and details of the peer-review process related to post-publication discussions.

            HANDLING POST-PUBLICATION MATTERS
          </h2>

          <p>
            To maintain the integrity of scientific research, Bentham Open investigates concerns raised by
            authors and or readers. Authors are provided an opportunity to respond to all complaints or comments.
            Reviewers may be asked to re-evaluate original data and consult subject experts to conclude the
            investigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the severity of the issue, one or more of the following actions may be taken:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>A corrigendum may be published.</li>
            <li>
              An Editor’s Note and or Editorial Expression of Concern may be published. A second notification may
              follow once the investigation is completed.
            </li>
            <li>The article may be retracted.</li>
            <li>
              In cases involving serious issues such as fraud or academic misconduct, the author’s institution
              may be informed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Bentham Open does not intend to target individuals. Its objective is transparency. Readers may be
            directed to publicly accessible institutional investigation reports where applicable.
          </p>

          <p>
            During an ongoing investigation, which may take time to conclude, an Editor’s Note and or Editorial
            Expression of Concern is published to inform readers of concerns related to the article, in
            accordance with recommendations from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).
          </p>

          <p>
            Editor’s Notes and Editorial Expressions of Concern are replaced with a revision, such as a
            corrigendum or retraction, once a final decision is reached following a complete investigation.
          </p>

          <p className="text-sm">
            <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> A message published to inform readers that an investigation has been
            initiated regarding concerns about published content. This notice is an online update and is not

          <p className="text-sm">
            <strong>Editorial Expression of Concern (EEoC):</strong> A declaration by the Editor alerting readers
